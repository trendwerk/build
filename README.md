# Build
Minimal config files for various build tools, which provide linting for different types of projects.

## Installation
Choose the type of project. Currently `JS`, `PHP` and `SCSS` are provided. Grab the contents from the folder of choice and place them in your project folder. When choosing `JS`, you should provide the `entryFile` and `outputFile` variables inside the config file.

Now you can run:

```sh
npm install
```

After installing is done, the build tool will start running.
